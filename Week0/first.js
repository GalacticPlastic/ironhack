console.log("Hello, world!");



// Basically the way you print out to the console messages in a JavaScript program
// is with a function called console.log. We will talk about functions a bit later,
// but suffice to say that you can use console.log to print out to the console any message you want.
// All you need to do is type console.log( (with parentheses), your message within quotes and
// finally a closing parentheses and semi-colon: );. Try different messages now:

// console.log(  "This needs to be in quotes or it won't work!"  );
// console.log(  "Help! I'm trapped in the computer."  );
