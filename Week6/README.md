Authentication & Authorization
=================

Distinctions between anon and existing users.

1. User Registration (Sign Up)
2. User Authentication (Login and Logout)

- Usernames and Passwords.
- Users log in and out. _Ex: Node.js npm passport (Facebook/multi social medialogin capabilities.)_
- Sessions.


###Two User Roles:

- Authenticated Users
	Can see their own profile.
- Admin
	Can see complete list of users.


Password encryption uses exact same encryption for exact same password.
